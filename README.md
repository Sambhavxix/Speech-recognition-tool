Description: Speech Recognition System
The Speech Recognition System is a basic yet functional speech-to-text application designed to transcribe short audio clips into written text. Built using Python, this project leverages pre-trained models and popular open-source libraries, such as SpeechRecognition, to provide a simple and effective solution for converting spoken language into readable text. The system is modular, easy to use, and serves as a strong foundation for further enhancements or integration into larger applications.

Motivation and Objectives
Speech recognition technology has become increasingly important in today’s digital world, powering applications like virtual assistants, automated transcription services, and accessibility tools. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the core principles of speech-to-text conversion using accessible tools and libraries. By focusing on a basic implementation, the project aims to provide a clear learning path for beginners while delivering a practical, working system.

System Architecture
The project is organized into several Python modules for clarity and maintainability:

speech_to_text.py: The main script that handles the transcription process. It loads an audio file, processes it using the SpeechRecognition library, and outputs the transcribed text.
audio_utils.py: Contains utility functions for audio file validation and duration calculation, ensuring that only supported formats (WAV) are processed and providing useful metadata.
config.py: Centralizes configuration settings such as the default audio file name and language code, making it easy to adapt the system to different use cases or languages.
requirements.txt: Lists all necessary Python dependencies, simplifying environment setup and ensuring reproducibility.
README.md: Provides comprehensive instructions, project overview, and suggestions for enhancements.
How It Works
The user places a short WAV audio file (e.g., sample.wav) in the project directory. Upon running the main script, the system checks the file format, calculates its duration, and then uses Google’s free speech recognition API (via the SpeechRecognition library) to transcribe the audio content. The resulting text is printed to the console, providing immediate feedback.

Key Features
Pre-trained Model Usage: Utilizes Google’s robust speech recognition engine, eliminating the need for custom model training.
Modular Design: Code is organized for readability and easy extension.
Audio Validation: Ensures only supported audio formats are processed, reducing errors.
Configurable Settings: Language and file settings can be easily changed in config.py.
Ready for Enhancement: The structure allows for adding features like microphone input, support for more audio formats, or integration with advanced models like Wav2Vec2.
Potential Enhancements
While the current system focuses on file-based transcription, it can be extended to support real-time microphone input, batch processing of multiple files, or the use of more advanced deep learning models for improved accuracy. The modular codebase makes such enhancements straightforward.

Conclusion
This Speech Recognition System provides a practical introduction to speech-to-text technology using Python and open-source tools. It is suitable for educational purposes, prototyping, or as a starting point for more complex applications. The project demonstrates the power and accessibility of modern speech recognition APIs and serves as a valuable addition to any portfolio or internship deliverable.
